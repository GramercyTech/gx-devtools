# GxP Plugin Development Guidelines

This is a GxP plugin project for the GxP kiosk platform. Follow these guidelines when working with this codebase.

## Development Workflow

Every task starts with understanding and ends with a validated, linted build. Do not skip steps.

### 1. Understand what the client is building

Before touching code, get specific about the feature:

- What is the user-facing outcome? Who uses it (attendee, staff, admin)?
- Which real-world data does it read or write?
- What events does it react to in real time?
- What needs to be configurable by an admin (text, assets, colors, thresholds, feature flags)?

Ask clarifying questions instead of guessing. A 30-second question beats a 30-minute rewrite.

### 2. Discover the right data sources via MCP

Use the `gxp-api` MCP server to ground the implementation in the real platform — never invent endpoints or event names.

**Verify the MCP is live before planning anything** by calling `api_list_tags`. The server is defined in `.mcp.json` at the project root and provided by the `gxp-api-server` binary that ships with `@gxp-dev/tools` (on PATH — check with `which gxp-api-server`). If the `api_*` / `config_*` / `docs_*` tools aren't available, tell the user to run `claude mcp add gxp-api gxp-api-server` (or `codex mcp add …` / add it to `~/.gemini/settings.json`) and restart the session. Do not proceed without the MCP.

- **Find endpoints** — `api_list_tags`, `api_list_operation_ids` (optionally scoped by tag), `search_api_endpoints` (keyword).
- **Inspect a specific endpoint** — `api_get_operation_parameters`, `get_endpoint_details`.
- **Find endpoints by payload shape** — `api_find_endpoints_by_schema` (search by request/response field names).
- **Find WebSocket events** — `api_find_events_for_operation` (given an operationId, returns events via `x-triggered-by`), `api_list_events`, `search_websocket_events`, `get_asyncapi_spec`. Run `api_find_events_for_operation` for every operationId you plan to call so you subscribe instead of polling.
- **Generate dependency JSON** — `api_generate_dependency` produces the canonical entry for `app-manifest.json` → `dependencies`.
- **Read the docs** — `docs_list_pages`, `docs_search`, `docs_get_page` (full-text search across docs.gxp.dev).

Output of this step: a short list of the operationIds, WebSocket events, and dependencies the plugin will use.

### 3. Plan with the client, including the admin config form

Before writing code, produce a plan and confirm it with the client. The plan must include:

- **Screens/components** — what's rendered and in which layout (Public/Private/System).
- **Data flow** — which store getters read which sections, which API calls populate them, which socket events mutate state.
- **Admin configuration form** — every piece of customizable content belongs in `configuration.json` as a card/field so admins can edit it without a code change. Cover text (strings), images (assets), colors/thresholds (settings), and feature toggles.
- **Strings and assets inventory** — the exact keys that will appear in `app-manifest.json`.

Do not proceed to implementation until the client has reviewed the plan.

### 4. Implement

Build against the plan:

- Use the GxP store for **all** data access — `store.callApi(operationId, identifier, data)` for platform API calls, plus sockets, strings, assets, settings, state. Never use `axios` or `fetch` directly.
- Declare every permission identifier used by `callApi` in `app-manifest.json` → `dependencies` + `permissions`. Use `"project"` for project-wide / top-level operations and pass any required IDs in `data`.
- Wire every piece of user-facing text with `gxp-string` and every image with `gxp-src` so the admin form controls them.
- Keep components under `src/`. The runtime container (layouts, routing, dev tools) is not yours to edit.

### 5. Sync the manifest and build the admin form

As soon as you've added a new `store.callApi`, `store.listen`, `gxp-string`, or `gxp-src` — and before you move on to testing — close the loop on the admin-editable surface:

1. **Extract the configurable surface into `app-manifest.json`.** Run the MCP tool `config_extract_strings` with `writeTo: "app-manifest.json"`. It scans `src/` for every `gxp-string`, `gxp-src`, `store.getString/getSetting/getAsset/getState`, and `store.callApi` identifier and merges the new keys into the manifest (linter-guarded; falls back to `gxdev extract-config` on the CLI if you need it). Do this every time you touch the plugin's public surface so the manifest never drifts from the code.

2. **Build `configuration.json` from what's in the manifest.** For every entry in the manifest, add a matching field in the admin form using the MCP `config_*` tools — they validate each write against the schema. Default mappings:

   | Manifest entry                                   | `configuration.json` field type                                                                  |
   | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `strings.default.*`                              | `text` (or `textarea` for long copy)                                                             |
   | `assets.*` (driven by `gxp-src`)                 | `selectAsset`                                                                                    |
   | `dependencies[]` — each identifier               | `asyncSelect` wired to the matching resource list endpoint (so the admin binds to a real record) |
   | `settings.*` that represent colors               | `colorPicker`                                                                                    |
   | `settings.*` that represent thresholds / numbers | `number`                                                                                         |
   | `settings.*` that represent feature toggles      | `boolean`                                                                                        |
   | Anything else discussed with the client          | Pick with `config_list_field_types` / `config_get_field_schema`                                  |

   Group related fields into `fields_list` cards (`config_add_card` + `config_add_field`). If you're unsure what field types exist, call `config_list_field_types` / `config_list_card_types` first. If a mutation is refused, read the validation error and fix the input — do not set `force: true`.

3. **Lint.** Run `gxdev lint --all` and fix every error before moving on.

### 6. Test with real broadcasts

Before declaring done, exercise the plugin against real event shapes:

- List available events — `gxdev socket list`.
- Send one — `gxdev socket send --event <EventName>` (edit or add payloads under `socket-events/`).
- Hit endpoints against the local mock API via the `test_api_route` MCP tool.
- Scaffold unit tests with `test_scaffold_component_test` for any non-trivial component.

### 7. Final lint

Step 5 already runs `gxdev lint --all`, but run it one more time after Step 6's test pass — test changes (adding mock payloads, tweaking identifiers) can re-introduce schema drift.

```bash
gxdev lint           # validate default targets
gxdev lint --all     # validate everything
```

Fix every error. Do not mark work complete with a failing lint.

## Project Architecture

This plugin runs inside a container environment provided by the `gxdev` development server. You should ONLY modify files in the `src/` directory. The runtime container (PortalContainer.vue) handles layouts, dev tools, routing, and store initialization.

```
src/
├── Plugin.vue          # MAIN ENTRY POINT - Your app starts here
├── components/         # Reusable Vue components
├── views/              # Page-level components
├── stores/index.js     # Re-exports useGxpStore
└── assets/             # Static assets
```

## Core Principle: Use the GxP Store for Everything

The `gxpPortalConfigStore` is the central hub for every piece of data — API, sockets, strings, assets, settings, state. Import it in any component:

```javascript
import { useGxpStore } from "@gx-runtime/stores/gxpPortalConfigStore"
const store = useGxpStore()
```

## API Calls — Use `store.callApi` with an Operation ID + Permission Identifier

**Every call to the GxP platform goes through `store.callApi`.** It handles authorization, URL resolution, team/project scoping, and path-parameter substitution. You only provide three things:

```javascript
await store.callApi(operationId, identifier, data)
```

| Argument      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operationId` | The OpenAPI operationId for the call. Look it up with `api_list_operation_ids` or `search_api_endpoints` (MCP). Never invent one.                                                                                                 |
| `identifier`  | A **permission identifier** declared in `app-manifest.json` → `dependencies` / `permissions`. Determines which resource's permissions the call runs under, and supplies the parent object ID that gets substituted into the path. |
| `data`        | Additional params — body fields, query params, or path params not covered by the identifier. Pass `"pluginVars.someKey"` as a value to pull from settings at call time.                                                           |

NEVER use axios/fetch directly. `apiGet`/`apiPost`/`apiPut`/`apiPatch`/`apiDelete` still exist as low-level escape hatches, but `callApi` is the default — only it participates in the permission model.

### Permission identifiers

Each identifier is declared in `app-manifest.json` and later bound by an admin to a specific resource + permission scope (read, create, update, delete). Pick identifiers that describe the **role the resource plays in the plugin**, not its name.

Example — a plugin that reads posts from one social stream and creates posts on another:

```json
// app-manifest.json
{
	"dependencies": [
		{ "identifier": "social_stream_one", "model": "SocialStream" },
		{ "identifier": "social_stream_two", "model": "SocialStream" }
	],
	"permissions": [
		{
			"identifier": "social_stream_one",
			"description": "Source stream — read posts"
		},
		{
			"identifier": "social_stream_two",
			"description": "Destination stream — create posts"
		}
	]
}
```

```javascript
// Read posts from the source stream
const posts = await store.callApi("posts.index", "social_stream_one")

// Create a post on the destination stream
await store.callApi("posts.store", "social_stream_two", {
	body: "Hello world",
	image_url: imageUrl,
})
```

The admin assigns `social_stream_one` read-only access to stream A and `social_stream_two` create access to stream B. The plugin code never hard-codes IDs.

### The `project` identifier — project-wide, top-level operations

When you need to create the parent resource itself (e.g. the social stream), or hit any endpoint scoped at the project level rather than to a specific dependency, use the reserved identifier `"project"`. `callApi` will run with project-wide permissions — but you must pass any path params the endpoint needs in `data`.

```javascript
// Create a new social stream under the project
const stream = await store.callApi("social_streams.store", "project", {
	name: "New Stream",
})

// Create a post directly against a known socialStreamId (no dependency binding)
await store.callApi("posts.store", "project", {
	socialStreamId: stream.id,
	body: "First post",
})
```

Rule of thumb:

- Operating on a resource the admin will bind later → declare a dependency identifier and pass it.
- Creating the parent resource itself, or acting across the whole project → use `"project"` and pass the relevant IDs in `data`.

### Low-level methods (avoid unless necessary)

```javascript
await store.apiGet("/api/v1/endpoint", { param: "value" })
await store.apiPost("/api/v1/endpoint", { data: "value" })
await store.apiPut("/api/v1/endpoint/123", { data: "value" })
await store.apiPatch("/api/v1/endpoint/123", { data: "value" })
await store.apiDelete("/api/v1/endpoint/123")
```

These bypass the permission model. Prefer `callApi`.

## Store Data Access

```javascript
// Get values with fallbacks
store.getString("key", "default") // From stringsList
store.getSetting("key", "default") // From pluginVars
store.getAsset("key", "/fallback.jpg") // From assetList
store.getState("key", null) // From triggerState
store.hasPermission("admin") // Check permissions

// Update values
store.updateString("key", "value")
store.updateSetting("key", "value")
store.updateAsset("key", "url")
store.updateState("key", "value")
```

## Real-Time Events

Every plugin has two streams of real-time events, both surfaced through the store:

1. **The `primary` channel** — a peer channel scoped to users of this plugin right now. Use it for in-app pub/sub (cursor positions, "someone just did X", remote controls).
2. **Platform API events** — defined in AsyncAPI at `${apiDocsBaseUrl}/api-specs/asyncapi.json` under `components.messages`. Each message can declare `x-triggered-by` pointing at an OpenAPI operationId. When the server handles that operation, the event fires — you subscribe instead of polling.

### The `primary` channel

```javascript
// Listen for a custom event from other users of this plugin
store.listen("primary", "cursor_moved", (data) => {
	console.log("Peer moved:", data)
})

// Broadcast to everyone else on the primary channel
store.broadcast("primary", "cursor_moved", { x: 42, y: 100 })
```

### Platform API events

Use the AsyncAPI form of `listen` — event name first, permission identifier second, callback third:

```javascript
store.listen("SocialStreamPostCreated", "social_stream_two", (post) => {
	console.log("New post on the destination stream:", post)
})
```

The permission identifier (`"social_stream_two"` above, or `"project"` for project-wide events) is the same identifier you pass to `callApi`. It scopes the subscription to the resource the admin bound for that identifier.

### Rule: whenever you add a `callApi`, check for a matching event

Before wiring polling or manual refresh after a mutation, ask: does this operation fire a socket event? Use the MCP:

- `api_find_events_for_operation` — given an operationId, returns every AsyncAPI message whose `x-triggered-by` matches. If it returns one, subscribe to it instead of polling.
- `api_list_events` — list every event, optionally filtered by `triggeredBy`.
- `search_websocket_events` — keyword search across events + channels.

Example: you just added `store.callApi("posts.store", "social_stream_two", {...})`. Run `api_find_events_for_operation({ operationId: "posts.store" })`, see `SocialStreamPostCreated`, subscribe with `store.listen("SocialStreamPostCreated", "social_stream_two", cb)`. No polling.

### Testing broadcasts locally

```bash
gxdev socket list                      # list available events
gxdev socket send --event EventName    # fire a test broadcast
```

Payloads live under `socket-events/` — add or edit a JSON file to define a new one.

## Vue Directives for Dynamic Content

Every piece of admin-editable content goes through a directive — that's what makes the configuration form meaningful.

```html
<!-- Text from strings -->
<h1 gxp-string="welcome_title">Fallback Title</h1>

<!-- Text from settings -->
<span gxp-string="company_name" gxp-settings>Company</span>

<!-- Images from assets -->
<img gxp-src="hero_image" src="/placeholder.jpg" alt="Hero" />
```

## Admin Configuration Form (`configuration.json`)

`configuration.json` defines the form admins use to customize the plugin after it ships. Every string, asset, dependency, color, and setting your plugin exposes must have a matching field here.

The full workflow — run it whenever you've added/changed a `callApi`, `listen`, `gxp-string`, or `gxp-src`:

1. **Extract the configurable surface into `app-manifest.json`** — `config_extract_strings` with `writeTo: "app-manifest.json"` (same logic as `gxdev extract-config` on the CLI). It scans `src/` for directives and store usage and merges the new keys into the manifest, linter-guarded.
2. **Add a form field in `configuration.json` for every manifest entry**, using the mapping below.
3. **Validate** — `config_validate` on demand, or `gxdev lint --all` at the end.

### Default field mapping

| Manifest source                                  | `configuration.json` field                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `strings.default.<key>`                          | `text` (short) or `textarea` (long)                                                         |
| `assets.<key>` (driven by `gxp-src`)             | `selectAsset`                                                                               |
| `dependencies[]` — each declared identifier      | `asyncSelect` bound to the matching resource list endpoint so the admin picks a real record |
| `settings.<key>` representing a color            | `colorPicker`                                                                               |
| `settings.<key>` representing a threshold/number | `number`                                                                                    |
| `settings.<key>` representing a feature toggle   | `boolean`                                                                                   |
| Any other setting discussed with the client      | Pick via `config_list_field_types` / `config_get_field_schema`                              |

Group related fields into `fields_list` cards (`config_add_card` then `config_add_field`). Use the `name` of each field to exactly match the manifest key it controls — that's the contract the directives and store getters rely on.

### Relevant tools

- `config_list_card_types`, `config_list_field_types` — enumerate what's available.
- `config_get_field_schema` — get the shape (required props, conditional rules) of a specific field type.
- `config_add_card`, `config_add_field`, `config_move_field`, `config_remove_field`, `config_move_card`, `config_remove_card` — mutate the form. Linter-guarded; invalid writes are refused.
- `config_extract_strings` — the manifest-sync entry point described above.
- `config_validate` — validate a file on demand.

If a mutation is refused, read the validation error and fix the input — do not reach for `force: true`.

## Form / Quiz / Survey Apps — `formTemplate`

Some plugins _are_ a form — a quiz, a survey, a signup questionnaire, a check-in flow. For those, the configuration file ships a second root-level card array, `formTemplate`, that holds the starter questions an admin customizes on install.

**Two keys tie this together. You must set both consistently.**

1. **`app-manifest.json` → `"formTemplate": true`** — declares the plugin as a form app. Platforms use this to opt the install into form-specific UI (question editor, response viewer, etc.).
2. **`configuration.json` → `"formTemplate": [ ...cards ]`** — the starter question set, structured identically to `additionalTabs`: an array of cards, typically `fields_list` sections, each with a `fieldsList` of question fields.

### Minimal example

```json
// app-manifest.json
{
	"name": "welcome-quiz",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"formTemplate": true,
	"settings": {},
	"strings": { "default": { "title": "Welcome Quiz" } },
	"assets": {},
	"dependencies": [],
	"permissions": []
}
```

```json
// configuration.json
{
	"additionalTabs": [
		/* admin-facing plugin config goes here as always */
	],
	"formTemplate": [
		{
			"type": "fields_list",
			"title": "About You",
			"fieldsList": [
				{ "type": "text", "name": "full_name", "label": "Full name" },
				{
					"type": "radio",
					"name": "experience",
					"label": "Experience level",
					"options": [
						{ "label": "Beginner", "value": "beginner" },
						{ "label": "Advanced", "value": "advanced" }
					]
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

### Building `formTemplate` with the MCP

Use the same `config_*` tools you'd use for `additionalTabs`, pointed at the `/formTemplate` root:

- `config_add_card` with `parent_path: "/formTemplate"` — the array is auto-initialized on first add, no seed step needed.
- `config_add_card` with `parent_path: "/formTemplate/0/cards"` — nest sub-cards if you need a `card_list` grouping.
- `config_add_field` with `card_path: "/formTemplate/0"` — add questions to a section.
- `config_list_cards` — lists cards from both `/additionalTabs` and `/formTemplate` with their JSON pointers.

Use the same field types as any other form (`text`, `textarea`, `number`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `select`, `asyncSelect`, `selectAsset`, etc.). Question names live under `fieldsList[].name` — these become the response keys the platform stores.

### When to use `formTemplate` vs `additionalTabs`

- `additionalTabs` — **admin** configuration form (every plugin has this). The person installing the plugin fills this in once.
- `formTemplate` — **end-user** form questions (only form apps). Admins may tweak these before publishing; end users (attendees, staff) answer them at runtime.

Don't confuse them. Strings, assets, dependencies, colors → `additionalTabs`. Quiz/survey questions that end users will answer → `formTemplate`.

Finish with `gxdev lint --all`. The linter validates both roots against the same card/field schema, so malformed questions fail in the same way malformed admin fields do.

## Component Kit

Import UI components from `@gramercytech/gx-componentkit`:

```javascript
import {
	GxButton,
	GxCard,
	GxInput,
	GxModal,
	GxSpinner,
} from "@gramercytech/gx-componentkit"
```

Available: GxButton, GxCard, GxInput, GxModal, GxSpinner, GxAlert, GxBadge, GxAvatar, GxProgress, GxTabs, GxAccordion

## Configuration Files

- `app-manifest.json` — strings, assets, settings, dependencies, permissions. Hot-reloaded in dev.
- `configuration.json` — admin-facing form definition (cards + fields).

## Linting

Run before declaring any change complete:

```bash
gxdev lint           # default targets
gxdev lint --all     # everything
gxdev lint --json    # machine-readable output
```

## Testing

- Socket events: `gxdev socket send --event EventName`
- API calls against local mock: `test_api_route` MCP tool
- Component tests: `test_scaffold_component_test` MCP tool
- Dev Tools: Press Ctrl+Shift+D
- Console: `window.gxDevTools.store()` to inspect store

## API Environments

Set `VITE_API_ENV` in `.env`:

- `mock` - Local mock server (default)
- `develop` - https://api.zenith-develop.env.eventfinity.app
- `staging` - https://api.efz-staging.env.eventfinity.app
- `production` - https://api.gramercy.cloud

## API Documentation

Prefer the MCP tools (`get_openapi_spec`, `search_api_endpoints`, `docs_search`, etc.) over fetching these URLs directly:

- OpenAPI Spec: https://api.zenith-develop.env.eventfinity.app/api-specs/openapi.json
- AsyncAPI Spec: https://api.zenith-develop.env.eventfinity.app/api-specs/asyncapi.json
- Webhooks: https://api.zenith-develop.env.eventfinity.app/api-specs/webhooks.json
